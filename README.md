### Tectonic_Plate_Calculator

# The purpose of this project is to calculate the movement of different tectonic plates. 
# When you run the code the first window to pop up has two entry boxes, and a submit button. 
# Below there is a button for fun facts about plate tectonics. 

## Enter the Year
# The first box you enter your birth year (this doesn’t necessarily have to be a birth year, it can be any year really) 
# and the second is for the current year (same as before, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the current year). 
# There is also a button you can press for a random fun fact about plate tectonics!

### Enter the Plate
# By pressing the submit button, a new page opens asking for what specific plate the user wants to know about it.
